# Unified XUL Platform (UXP)

This repository holds the code for a unified application platform for XUL-based
applications. It is a hard fork from the Mozilla code repository (mozilla-central)
with an ESR-52 fork point.

In addition to further development based on the Mozilla upstream code, and
selective cherry-picking of directly-applicable patches, this repository has its
own development and holds the base for a maintained platform to be used by XUL
applications.

## Additional documentation

Additional documentation relevant to this source code can be found in the `/docs`
directory. This will contain relevant documentation regarding contributing,

If you are interested in the development and building side of things, some
information will be available on the [Pale Moon developer site](http://developer.palemoon.org).
You are also always welcome to get in touch with our community on the [Pale Moon forum](https://forum.palemoon.org/).

### Code search

encouraged to instead use the dedicated code search and cross-referencing site:
