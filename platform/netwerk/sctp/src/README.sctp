The usrsctp library is based on the FreeBSD kernel implementation, and the
userspace implementation was largely done my Michael Tuexen and Irene
Rungler of the Munster University of Applied Sciences.  Thanks also to
Randall Stewart for his help.

The library is covered by a BSD license - see headers in files.
