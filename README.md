# Phantom Satellite web browser

This is the source code for the Phantom Satellite web browser, a rebranded but otherwise stock fork of Pale Moon with the intention of being free to distribute.

The only difference between this and stock Pale Moon is branding, at least for now, I'd like for it to eventually become something more. I'm not opposed to applying any cool patches that are submitted or that I find myself, preferably patches that can be directly applied to stock Pale Moon (and dont conflict with my existing branding patch) so that updating the base for this browser can remain as simple as possible.

I personally wouldnt mind having Windows XP support restored, and Id also like to be able to do non SSE builds for ancient CPUS (both of these mostly for fun), but I don't know how to do this. Any help would be appreciated.

The contributor information is partially wrong, its like that becuase I accidentally uploaded without a fresh "git init" a while back, so it had the contribtor and commit info from the normal Pale Moon repo. I don't know of any way to fix it.

You can build Phantom Satellite the same way you build stock Pale Moon using the instructions on the Pale Moon website
